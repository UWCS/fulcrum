## Naming

UWCS has a tradition of naming projects by a convoluted scheme. Previous names for websites are: Reinhardt, Zarya, Dextre, and Stardust. The generic theme is rough links. Reinhardt and Zarya are both characters in Overwatch; Zarya and Dextre are both things on the International Space Station; Stardust is the significantly upgraded version of the Dexter malware (we struggled with this). Stardust is also the codename of the Death Star in Star Wars, fulcrum is the codename of Asoka Tano in Star Wars.  

For future projects branching off stardust, I would reccomend Henry Cavill Movies; for this site something physisc-y (Fulcrum is the pivot point of a lever).
