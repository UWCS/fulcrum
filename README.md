# fulcrum
An events website for UWCS

Key features include:
- [X] Event creation and management
- [X] Integration with UWCS auth
- [X] iCal generation
- [ ] Automated publicity
- [ ] Initial email generation
- [X] API
- [X] Search
- more soonTM

Note the site uses the same stack (Flask, SQLAlchemy) as [CS139](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/modules/cs139/), to enable easy maintenance and development by most DCS students. As a result, it is reccomended that no frameworks should be used (so no React, Vue, etc), small amounts of JS are acceptable (for example, form validation and reccomentations), but the site should be primarily server-rendered.

## Running

```bash
pip install pipenv
pipenv install
pipenv run python ./scripts/build_scss.py
pipenv run flask --app fulcrum run --debug
```

Note some computers may require `python -m pipvenv ...` instead of pipenv

For production, use a gunicorn server:

```bash
...
pipenv run gunicorn fulcrum:app -b 0.0.0.0:5000
```

Alternarively, you can run the site in a docker container:

```bash
docker build -t fulcrum .
docker run -p 5000:5000 fulcrum
```

### SSL Note

The app uses UWCS's keycloak server for authentication. This is set to enable both http and https as redirect URIs ONLY WHEN RUNNING LOCALLY (127.0.0.1). The app is configured such that if `app.debug` is true, http is used, otherwise https is used. As a result when running locally out of debug mode, https must be used. This can be done by running `pipenv run flask --app fulcrum run --cert=adhoc`

## API

Fulcrum exposes an API at `/api/` that allows for event management for external applications. This exposes the same functionality as the website's UI, just in program-oriented format.

The API is documented at `/apidocs/` using [flasgger](https://github.com/flasgger/flasgger) and is automatically generated from docstrings in the code.

The endpoints that allow for the creation, modification, and deletion of events require authentication. This can either be done by:
- Loggining in via the website, which will set a session cookie (requires the user to be exec or sysadmin)
- Using the `Authorization` header with an API key. These can be generated and managed by execs at `/auth/keys/`

## Naming

UWCS has a tradition of naming projects by a convoluted scheme. Previous names for websites are: Reinhardt, Zarya, Dextre, and Stardust. The generic theme is rough links. Reinhardt and Zarya are both characters in Overwatch; Zarya and Dextre are both things on the International Space Station; Stardust is the significantly upgraded version of the Dexter malware (we struggled with this). Stardust is also the codename of the Death Star in Star Wars, fulcrum is the codename of Asoka Tano in Star Wars.  

For future projects branching off stardust, I would reccomend Henry Cavill Movies; for this site something physisc-y (Fulcrum is the pivot point of a lever).
